## Our Vision

The Desi Chicken from Heritage Roots is a premium-quality meat sourced directly from native Desi Nati birds, a breed indigenous to India. Raised on a family farm in the lush, green hills of Chikmagalur, these chickens are a true taste of tradition.

## Key characteristics of the Heritage Roots Desi Chicken:

### Authentic Native Breed:

The chickens are of the Desi Nati breed, known for its firm texture and rich, authentic flavor that is distinct from commercially raised poultry.

### Raised Naturally:

They are 100% free-range, raised the "natural way â€” in the open air, under the sun." The farm avoids all chemicals, antibiotics, and artificial methods, ensuring the meat is clean and pure.

### Ethical and Honest Farming:

The birds are part of a farming philosophy that respects nature. The farm focuses on honest, traditional methods, rejecting the shortcuts and mass-production techniques of commercial farming.

### Superior Taste and Nutrition:

The result of this natural upbringing is meat that is described as delicious, nutritious, and full of flavor, offering a genuine "taste of tradition."
