## Our Mission

Heritage Roots Desi Eggs are a premium, natural product sourced from Native Desi Nati birds raised in the serene hills of the Western Ghats. These eggs are the result of traditional, free-range farming where the chickens roam freely, ensuring an ethical and natural upbringing.

## Key characteristics of Heritage Roots Desi Eggs

### Authentic Breed :

They come exclusively from native Desi Nati chickens, prized for their authentic taste and nutritional value.

### Completely Natural :

The eggs are produced without the use of any chemicals or antibiotics, offering a pure and healthy choice for you and your family.

### Rich in Flavor and Nutrients :

They are described as having a rich, distinct flavor and high nutritional content, reminiscent of the wholesome eggs from a traditional village upbringing.

### Farmed with Care :

Each egg is a reflection of the farm's commitment to purity, tradition, and trust, supporting honest, village-based farming rather than mass production.
